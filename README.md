# parallax-effects

Parallax effects are one of the effects I like the most. It gives any website some sort of modern looking.

In this project I created a page for a events decoration company, which have two different kinds of parallax effects.
CSS is the most basic one and JS is just a bit more lines of code, but pretty useful to add "motion" to the effect.

To structure the project in a modern way, I used the tools from Babel and Webpack.
